## Introduction

I was curious about the size of the podcast industry. As a participant, I wanted to understand two key numbers often used to measure the market. 

First, a U.S. figure from the IAB showed that annual podcast advertising revenue in 2023 was nearly $2 billion. Second, Grandview Research estimated the entire podcast market, including all segments, to be $20 billion a year. This number seemed off to me.

So, I decided to explore these numbers myself. Using Claude AI as my research assistant, I've collected  annual returns, financial statements, and other public information. Using this data, I've had Claude estimate the size of each category. 

My goal here is to publish these findings here, and have this page function as a sort of collaborative wiki that anyone can contribute to.

[This page is hosted on a public GitHub repo](https://github.com/TransistorFM/podcastindustry.org/); anyone can issue a pull request with sources and rationale. 

My hope is that the contributions and discussion about these numbers here would lead to a more accurate estimate of the podcast industry's size.

- Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Total current range: $3.935 billion - $4.75 billion (likely to increase as we add estimates for additional categories)

This estimate is based on publicly available financial data, industry reports, and reasonable assumptions where specific data is not available. Each category's estimate is explained in detail in the sections below.

It's important to note that the podcast industry is rapidly evolving, and these figures may change quickly. Additionally, there may be some overlap between categories, and the global nature of the industry makes precise estimation challenging. However, this breakdown provides a comprehensive view of the current state of the podcast industry's revenue streams.

## Breakdown by Category

### 1. Podcast Advertising

Estimated annual revenue: $2.9 - $3.2 billion

Sources:
- IAB U.S. Podcast Advertising Revenue Study (2023): $1.9 billion in U.S. podcast ad revenue[^1]
- IAB Australia Podcast Advertising Market Report (2023)[^2]
- WARC Global Advertising Trends Report (2023)[^3]
- Oberlo Digital Ad Spend by Country Report (2023)[^4]

Rationale:
The IAB study provides a concrete figure for the U.S. market at $1.9 billion. To estimate the global market, we analyzed data from multiple sources (above).

Based on this data, we estimate that the U.S. represents approximately 60-65% of the global podcast advertising market. This is higher than our initial estimate due to:

a) The U.S. market's advanced podcast monetization compared to other countries.
b) The relative size of the U.S. digital ad market compared to other major markets.
c) The dominance of U.S.-based podcast platforms and networks globally.

Calculating from the U.S. revenue of $1.9 billion:
- If U.S. is 65% of global: $1.9 billion / 0.65 = $2.92 billion global
- If U.S. is 60% of global: $1.9 billion / 0.60 = $3.17 billion global

This results in our estimated range of $2.9 - $3.2 billion for global podcast advertising revenue.

It's important to note that this estimate is based on available data primarily from English-speaking countries and major digital advertising markets. The actual figure could be higher if we had more comprehensive data from non-English speaking markets with growing podcast industries.

### 2. Podcast Hosting

Estimated annual revenue: $100 - $150 million

Sources:
- Libsyn financial statements: $32.7 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^5]
- Acast financial statements: Approximately $17.3 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^6]
- Market share estimates based on total RSS feeds data, excluding free hosting platforms[^7]
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^11]

Rationale:
We start with known revenue from two major players: Libsyn ($32.7M) and Acast ($17.3M). Using the RSS feed data, but excluding free hosting platforms (Anchor/Spotify for Podcasters, Soundcloud, and Feedburner), we can recalculate market shares:

- Total paid hosting feeds: 1,034,606
- Libsyn: 100,043 feeds (9.67% of paid market)
- Acast: 40,119 feeds (3.88% of paid market)

Extrapolating from Libsyn's revenue and market share suggests a total market of $338M ($32.7M / 9.67%). Using Acast's figures suggests $446M ($17.3M / 3.88%). However, these extrapolations assume similar revenue per podcast across all hosts, which is likely not accurate.

From the Reddit threads, we see hosting costs ranging from $0 (using free platforms) to about $20/month for paid services. Let's assume an average of $10/month for podcasters who pay for hosting.

Using our estimate of 1,034,606 paid hosting feeds, and assuming 80% of these are actively paying (some may be on free trials or inactive):

827,684 * $10 * 12 months = $99,322,080

Considering that:
1. Larger hosts may have economies of scale
2. Many podcasts generate little to no revenue
3. There's a wide range of pricing among hosts

We conservatively estimate the paid podcast hosting market to be between $100 million and $150 million annually. This range accounts for the known data while acknowledging the limitations of our extrapolation method.

### 3. Podcasting Equipment

Estimated annual revenue: $285 - $300 million

Sources:
- Audio-Technica annual statement (2023)[^8]
- Sennheiser Group press release (2023)[^9]
- Logitech SEC filing regarding Blue Microphones acquisition (2018)[^10]

Rationale:
This estimate is based on financial data from major audio equipment manufacturers, with assumptions about what percentage of their sales are related to podcasting. We estimated Sennheiser's podcasting revenue at $85.2 million (15% of total), Blue Microphones at $47.6 million (40% of total, adjusted for growth since 2018), and Audio-Technica at $2.6 million (10% of microphone sales). Assuming these companies represent 45-50% of the market, we arrive at a total market estimate of $285-300 million.

### 4. Direct Listener Support

Estimated annual revenue: $350 million

Sources:
- Patreon press release: "Podcasters earned over $350 million from their real fans on Patreon last year" (2023)[^11]

Rationale:
This figure comes directly from Patreon's press release. While there are other platforms for direct listener support (like Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, etc.), Patreon is the dominant player in this space for podcasters. The $350 million likely represents a significant majority of direct listener support for podcasters.

### 5. Podcast Production Services

Estimated annual revenue: $120 - $180 million

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^12]
- Extrapolation based on the number of active podcasts[^7]

Rationale:
Many podcasters mentioned hiring editors or production teams in the Reddit threads. Costs varied widely, but we assumed an average of $100 per episode for those who outsource. Assuming 10% of active podcasts (103,460) use these services monthly:

103,460 * $100 * 12 months = $124,152,000

We've provided a range to account for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 6. Podcast Recording and Editing Software

Estimated annual revenue: $100 - $150 million

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^12]
- Extrapolation based on the number of active podcasts[^7]

Rationale:
Many podcasters mentioned using software like Descript, Riverside.fm, Squadcast, GarageBand, and Adobe Audition. We estimated that about 30% of active podcasters use paid software, with an average monthly cost of $25:

310,381 * $25 * 12 months = $93,114,300

We've provided a range to account for free software users and potential variations in pricing and usage.

### 7. Podcast Analytics and Measurement Tools

Estimated annual revenue: $50 - $75 million

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^12]
- Extrapolation based on the number of paid hosting users[^7]

Rationale:
Several podcasters mentioned using analytics tools. We assumed 20% of paid hosting users subscribe to such services at an average of $20/month:

206,921 * $20 * 12 months = $49,661,040

The range accounts for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 8. Podcast Transcription Services

Estimated annual revenue: $15 - $25 million

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^12]
- Extrapolation based on the number of paid hosting users[^7]

Rationale:
Some podcasters mentioned using transcription services. We assumed 15% of paid hosting users use these services at an average of $10 per episode, monthly:

155,190 * $10 * 12 months = $18,622,800

The range accounts for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 9. Podcast Consulting and Education

Estimated annual revenue: To be determined

Sources: [To be added]

Rationale: This category would include revenue from podcast consultants, online courses, workshops, and educational resources about podcasting.

### 10. Podcast Events and Conferences

Estimated annual revenue: $15 - $20 million

Sources:
- Podcast Movement website[^12]
- The Podcast Show London website[^13]
- PodFest sponsor deck[^14]

Rationale:
This estimate is based on data from major podcast conferences and an estimation of smaller events worldwide:

1. Major conferences:
   - Podcast Movement (2 events): ~$3 - $3.5 million annually
   - The Podcast Show London: ~$950,000 - $1.2 million
   - PodFest: ~$700,000 - $900,000

2. Other conferences and events:
   Estimated 20-30 additional events generating an average of $250,000 - $350,000 each.
   Estimated total for smaller events: $5 - $10.5 million

The estimate includes ticket sales and sponsorship revenues. For major events, we calculated based on reported attendance figures and estimated average ticket prices. Sponsorship revenues were estimated based on publicly available sponsorship packages.

This estimate is likely conservative as it may not fully account for:
- Associated revenue streams (workshops, merchandise, etc.)
- Rapid growth in the podcast event industry
- Potential underreporting of attendee numbers or ticket prices

### 11. Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Estimated annual revenue: To be determined

Sources: [To be added]

Rationale: This category would cover revenues generated by podcast networks through means other than advertising, such as content licensing, merchandise, or other monetization strategies.

## Methodology and Limitations

This estimate is based on publicly available financial data, industry reports, and reasonable assumptions where specific data is not available. The actual global podcast industry revenue may differ due to:

1. Limited financial data from private companies
2. Rapid changes in the industry
3. Varying definitions of what constitutes podcast-related revenue
4. Potential overlap between categories (e.g., some hosting providers also offer advertising services)

Further research and data collection could help refine this estimate.

## Final notes

The goal here, whenever possible, is to avoid sourcing generalized estimates from other sites (like Statistica, Latka, CB Insights, LeadIQ, etc) that don't share their methodology.
