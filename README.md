# How big is the global podcast market?

## Purpose of this report

We're building this estimate primarily to provide transparency to industry participants. An accurate sense of how big the podcast industry is (and how fast it's growing) can help us make strategic decisions. Overestimating the size of the industry could lead to:

- Misallocation of resources: Companies might overinvest in podcasting based on inflated market expectations, leading to inefficient use of capital. Spotify experienced this when it overinvested in 2021.[^1]
- Increased competition and market saturation: An overestimated market might attract more competitors than the actual market can sustain, potentially leading to a "race to the bottom" in pricing and unsustainable business models.
- Financial risks and investor disappointment: Overestimation can lead to inflated valuations and unrealistic revenue forecasts, potentially resulting in financial strain, layoffs, and disappointed investors when actual results don't meet expectations.

## Introduction

Currently, two public numbers are often cited to describe the overall value of the podcasting industry:

1. [A figure from the IAB](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IAB_US_Podcast_Advertising_Revenue_Study_FY2023_May_2024.pdf) shows that annual podcast advertising revenue in the USA was nearly \$2 billion in 2023.
2. The second number is from [Grandview Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/podcast-market#:~\:text=How%20big%20is%20the%20podcasting,USD%2023.75%20billion%20in%202023.), who estimates the entire podcast market, including all segments, to be \$20 billion a year.

Unfortunately, neither the IAB nor Grandview Research have shared a meticulous description of their methodology or sources, which makes it difficult to verify or substantiate their estimates.

We've collected annual returns, financial statements, and other public information. Using this data, we estimate the size of each sub-category within the podcast industry.

We will continually update and publish findings here, and this page will function as a collaborative wiki that anyone can contribute to.

[This page is hosted on a public GitHub repo](https://github.com/TransistorFM/podcastindustry.org/); anyone can issue a pull request with sources and rationale.

I hope that the contributions and discussion about these numbers here would lead to an accurate estimate of the podcast industry's size.

## Overview

**Our estimate for the global podcast industry's annual revenue is approximately \$3.94 - \$4.95 billion.**

This estimate is based on available data from various segments of the podcast industry, including advertising, hosting, equipment, direct listener support, events, and other related categories.



### Breakdown by category:

| Category                                | 2024                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Podcast Advertising                     | \$3.0 - \$3.4 billion       |
| Podcast Hosting                         | \$100 - \$150 million       |
| Podcasting Equipment                    | \$285 - \$300 million       |
| Direct Listener Support                 | \$400 - \$450 million       |
| Podcast Production Services             | \$120 - \$180 million       |
| Podcast Recording and Editing Software  | \$100 - \$150 million       |
| Podcast Events and Conferences          | \$15 - \$20 million         |
| Podcast Analytics and Measurement Tools | \$50 - \$75 million         |
| Podcast Transcription Services          | \$15 - \$25 million         |
| **Total**                               | **\$3.94 - \$4.95 billion** |

Categories that still need to be estimated:

- Podcast Consulting and Education
- Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Each category's estimate is explained in detail in the sections below.

It's important to note that the podcast industry is rapidly evolving, and these figures may change quickly. Additionally, there may be some overlap between categories, and the global nature of the industry makes precise estimation challenging.

## Breakdown by Category

### 1. Podcast Advertising

**Estimated annual revenue: \$3.0 - \$3.4 billion**

Sources:

- IAB U.S. Podcast Advertising Revenue Study (2023): \$1.9 billion in U.S. podcast ad revenue[^2]
- DWNLOAD Q3 2024 Report: Highlights stronger-than-expected growth with significant increases in programmatic ad sales and political advertising[^34]
- SiriusXM, iHeartMedia, and Acast financials indicating growth above industry averages[^34†source]

Rationale:
The strong Q3 2024 performance across major platforms suggests podcast advertising is growing faster than originally forecasted. Programmatic and political ads have provided additional revenue boosts.

### 2. Podcast Hosting

**Estimated annual revenue: \$100 - \$150 million**

Sources:

- Libsyn financial statements: \$32.7 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^6]
- Acast financial statements: Approximately \$17.3 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^7]

### 3. Podcasting Equipment

**Estimated annual revenue: \$285 - \$300 million**

Sources:

- Sennheiser Group’s revenue: \$527.2 million in professional audio, with some attribution to podcast-related sales[^23†source]
- Logitech’s historical focus on podcasting microphones through Blue Microphones[^22†source]

### 4. Direct Listener Support

**Estimated annual revenue: \$400 - \$450 million**

Sources:

- Patreon report: Podcasters earned over \$350 million on Patreon alone in 2023[^24†source]

### 5. Podcast Production Services

**Estimated annual revenue: \$120 - \$180 million**

Rationale:
Many podcasters mentioned hiring editors or production teams in surveys. Costs vary widely, but the growth in this sector aligns with broader industry trends.

### 6. Podcast Recording and Editing Software

**Estimated annual revenue: \$100 - \$150 million**

Rationale:
Software like Descript and Adobe Audition are seeing increased adoption among creators.

### 7. Podcast Analytics and Measurement Tools

**Estimated annual revenue: \$50 - \$75 million**

Rationale:
The push for better analytics to support programmatic advertising growth is accelerating demand.

### 8. Podcast Events and Conferences

**Estimated annual revenue: \$15 - \$20 million**

Rationale:
Live events continue to play a niche but important role, with platforms like Patreon supporting IRL fan interactions.

### 9. Podcast Transcription Services

**Estimated annual revenue: \$15 - \$25 million**

Rationale:
Growth in accessibility tools, particularly for transcription, supports this estimate.

### 10. Podcast Events and Conferences

**Estimated annual revenue: $15 - $20 million**

Sources:
- Podcast Movement website[^15]
- The Podcast Show London website[^16]
- PodFest sponsor deck[^17]

Rationale:
This estimate is based on data from major podcast conferences and an estimation of smaller events worldwide:

1. Major conferences:
   - Podcast Movement (2 events): ~$3 - $3.5 million annually
   - The Podcast Show London: ~$950,000 - $1.2 million
   - PodFest: ~$700,000 - $900,000

2. Other conferences and events:
   Estimated 20-30 additional events generating an average of $250,000 - $350,000 each.
   Estimated total for smaller events: $5 - $10.5 million

The estimate includes ticket sales and sponsorship revenues. For major events, we calculated based on reported attendance figures and estimated average ticket prices. Sponsorship revenues were estimated based on publicly available sponsorship packages.

This estimate is likely conservative as it may not fully account for:
- Associated revenue streams (workshops, merchandise, etc.)
- Rapid growth in the podcast event industry
- Potential underreporting of attendee numbers or ticket prices

### 11. Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Estimated annual revenue: To be determined

Sources: [To be added]

Rationale: This category would cover revenues generated by podcast networks through means other than advertising, such as content licensing, merchandise, or other monetization strategies.

## Methodology and Limitations

This estimate is based on publicly available financial data, industry reports, and reasonable assumptions where specific data is unavailable. The actual global podcast industry revenue may differ due to:

1. Limited financial data from private companies
2. Rapid changes in the industry
3. Varying definitions of what constitutes podcast-related revenue
4. Potential overlap between categories (e.g., some hosting providers also offer advertising services)

Further research and data collection could help refine this estimate.

## Final notes

The goal here, whenever possible, is to avoid sourcing generalized estimates from other sites (like Statistica, Latka, CB Insights, LeadIQ, etc) that don't share their methodology.

[^10]: In the Annual Report for 2023, on page 20 under "Net sales breakdown", there's a note that says: "Acast's net sales are mainly generated from advertising revenue recognized over time. Just over 11% of Acast net sales are generated by non-ad revenue streams, such as SaaS and subscription revenue, for the reporting periods presented." Given that Acast's total net sales for 2023 were 1,636.4 million SEK (as stated multiple times in the report), we can calculate 11% of 1,636.4 million SEK = 179.9 million SEK. Converting to USD at an approximate exchange rate of 0.096 SEK to USD: 179.9 million SEK * 0.096 = $17.27 million USD
