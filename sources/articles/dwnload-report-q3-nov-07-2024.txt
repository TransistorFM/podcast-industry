Hello and welcome to The DWNLOAD Report: The State of the Podcast Industry Q3 2024.

What a quarter it’s been! For those of you following along, you’ll know that 2024 is shaping up to be a banner year for podcasting. While everyone else was busy pronouncing “peak podcasting” a few years ago, DWNLOAD Media has been bullish about the sustained value of audio, and Q3 only strengthens our thesis: podcasting is the most undervalued asset in media. Here’s why the big players—and soon, maybe you—are placing their bets on this industry.

A quick note: I have quarterly recaps for the major podcast platforms below. However, Spotify doesn’t report until next week. While I was planning on waiting, I think the buzz around podcasting is too hot not to dive in now, especially since Spotify doesn’t break out specific podcast revenue numbers. That said, I will post an update on LinkedIn after their earnings call, but looking into my crystal ball, I expect to hear Daniel Ek say, “Podcast advertising revenue continues to be a strong growth area” or “Podcast advertising revenue growth continues to outperform, etc.” If we hear anything extremely newsworthy, I will share a quick update via email.

Also, I've heard from some readers who’d like to see more frequent updates and expanded earnings coverage (which now includes Acast & Audioboom). So, I’d love to get your input: Would you prefer more regular insights and commentary, or do you like the current format as a quarterly deep dive? Let me know—I’m all ears!

Alright, let’s get into it:

Political Spotlight: Podcasts Are Now the “It” Medium for Campaigns
I didn’t want to write about the election, but we cannot overstate how 2024 truly was the “podcast election.” Trump’s three-hour appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast generated nearly 50 million views on YouTube alone—compared to his more traditional media appearances, it’s no contest… and this doesn’t count his millions of listeners on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about impact. On podcasts, candidates get hours of uninterrupted airtime, reaching highly engaged, targeted audiences. Traditional media can’t match this depth or precision.

And Rogan isn’t the only one leading the charge. Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy interview with Kamala Harris also generated a ton of buzz, outperforming other high-profile interviews like Howard Stern’s and Charlamagne tha God’s on Google Trends.


Trump seemed to see this trend well before the Harris campaign, doing numerous podcasts like Theo Von, Bussin with the Boys, and many others that young men heavily consume. Hell, when Trump turned the mic over to Dana White at his victory party, White specifically thanked numerous podcast hosts by name. This is not a coincidence. The New York Times and Wired wrote good pieces on this.

In another article, the Times focused on the future of media consumption, and DWNLOAD Media partner, and Red Seat Ventures CEO Chris Balfe was highlighted by saying, “Clearly that’s where the media consumption is going, and, therefore, that’s where political candidates need to go to reach that audience,” referring to podcasts. On iHeartMedia’s earnings call this morning, Bob Pittman highlighted the “ignored consumer” and underscored how podcasts have become the most effective way to reach this audience. He’s absolutely right. iHeart has long been a leader in connecting with this demographic through AM radio, so seeing them double-down on podcasting to replace declining broadcast revenue makes sense.

For those of us investing in media, this trend isn’t just an interesting quirk—it’s a clear indication of where audience engagement is headed. Podcasts are where political influence is being built. But let’s also take a step back and look at a larger trend: Howard Stern (red) vs. Joe Rogan (blue) from 2004-present:


This is exactly what we’ve been talking about - a fundamental shift from traditional audio to digital podcasts, and it’s starting to happen much quicker. In 2017, 66% of spoken word audio went to AM/FM radio and 13% to Podcasting. Today, AM/FM accounts for only 43% of spoken word listening, and podcasts 36%. If you take out boomers, podcasting has already surpassed AM/FM. Yet the transfer of revenue hasn’t followed at the same pace.

This shift also foreshadows what’s next for advertisers and brands: as podcasts continue to grow in audience & influence, we’ll see a significant increase in ad spend. Podcasting ad revenue growth, while continually outpacing all other forms of digital media, is still undervalued, in my opinion. The revenue opportunity cannot be understated.

Podcasting Is Media’s Best Bet

Podcasting isn’t just here to stay; it’s here to dominate. Whether it’s political influence, digital media’s best advertising growth opportunity, or the rise of subscription models, the fundamentals of podcasting’s growth are stronger than ever. For anyone considering an investment in media, podcasting is where the growth is—and DWNLOAD Media is here to guide you through it.

Until next quarter,

Earnings Recap:
SiriusXM

"Podcasting remains a tailwind." – Jennifer Witz, SiriusXM CEO

SiriusXM’s Q3 earnings showed $2.17 billion in revenue (a 4% year-over-year decline) and a net loss largely due to a Liberty Media-related non-cash impairment. But the bright spot? Podcasting continues to shine. The company reported a 6% increase in podcast ad revenue and 28% Q3 growth in the podcast segment, with programmatic ad sales up an astounding 97% year-over-year.

Key partnerships with SmartLess and Call Her Daddy have clearly been pivotal, helping SiriusXM maintain its annual forecast of $2.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow. Despite traditional ad revenue challenges (down 16%), podcast ad sales continue to outperform and validate what we've been seeing industry-wide: podcasts aren’t just growing; they’re driving strategic shifts for media giants and, in this case, SiriusXM's future.

This is the trend to watch. Just a year ago, many investors questioned podcasting’s long-term viability, yet quarterly results from major platforms tell a different story. SiriusXM’s "off-platform" revenue, which includes podcasting, rose 4% year-over-year and 18% sequentially due to strengthening podcast margins. It’s clear that without podcasting, these earnings would look quite different—underscoring how central podcasts have become to growth across the media industry.

iHeartMedia


Revenue Growth: Q3 revenue rose 5.8% year-over-year to $1.008 billion, in line with expectations. Excluding political revenue, growth was 2%.

Debt Restructuring: iHeartMedia announced a $4.1 billion debt exchange, extending maturities by three years.

Segment Performance:
- Digital Audio Group: Revenue climbed 13% to $301 million, with podcast revenue up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 7% to $100 million.
- Multiplatform Group: Revenue dipped 1% to $620 million, with Adjusted EBITDA down 20% at a 21% margin. Excluding political revenue, Q3 revenue was down 3%.
- Audio & Media Services Group: Strong growth, with revenue up 45% to $90 million and Adjusted EBITDA surging 162% at a margin of 49.3%.

Liquidity: Operating cash flow reached $103 million, with $73 million in free cash flow. Cash and liquidity totaled $432 million and $858 million, respectively.

As I’ve continued to highlight, companies like iHeart are pushing hard to replace declining AM/FM revenue and audiences with digital audio, especially podcasts. This restructuring may buy them more time, but the audience shift to podcasts is accelerating faster than ever.

On Podcasts: Podcasts were front and center on the call, generating $114M in revenue for Q3, up 11%. Just like other major audio platforms, iHeart is doubling down on podcasting as a high-growth segment, and they’re not being quiet about it. Bob Pittman even likened podcasts to “the Netflix of audio,” positioning radio as traditional TV. If that doesn’t show where the future is, I don’t know what will.

Acast

Acast’s latest earnings show a clear path toward sustainable, profitable growth in audio. With strong revenue momentum, focused cost management, and strategic expansion, Acast is a great example of disciplined growth in action. As of writing this, the stock is up ≈4%.

Here are a few things that stood out:

1. Solid Revenue Growth – Net sales reached SEK 475.4 million (about $43 million USD) this quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase, with 29% growth in North America. If you've been tracking the earnings of major audio platforms, it’s clear: podcast revenue is in strong growth mode.

2. Focused on Profitability – With a 40% gross margin and SEK 16 million in EBITDA, CEO Ross Adams highlights Acast’s disciplined approach: “Our Q3 financial performance underscores our commitment to profitable growth while making measured investments.” As highlighted in the DWNLOAD Media Report earlier this year, companies need to focus on sustainable & profitable growth, and Acast understands this and is well on its way.

3. Global Expansion – Acast’s growth is propelled by strategic investments in North America and steady gains in Europe and other markets, fueling further opportunity across regions. This is a key theme: the broader global podcast market remains under-monetized, even as audience growth continues to outpace other forms of media. I'd argue that even the U.S. market is severely undervalued. I'll say it again: we are in the very early stages of the podcast industry, creating an extremely appealing investment opportunity.

4. Creator Economy Monetization – Acast’s more than $410 million in payouts to creators (all-time, not in Q3) highlights a key point: audio remains an undervalued, high-potential segment in the creator economy. The sustained growth of audio shows how much-untapped opportunity exists for those willing to invest in creator-driven monetization and engage with this dynamic space.

Acast and the team do a great job of laying out their quarterly earnings (including a podcast!), so it's worth diving in yourself.

Audioboom

Audioboom's Q3 results show $18.8M in revenue—a 34% year-over-year increase. The company also hit record ad bookings of $84.5M for the year so far, proving that advertisers and audiences alike are betting on podcasting.

With audience and revenue growth during election season, Audioboom has adjusted its projections upward for the rest of 2024. Not only are brands and listeners flocking to podcasts during election season, but so are the Presidential candidates (as we noted above). More here.
