Hello, and welcome to the final DWNLOAD Report of 2024!

Unless some breaking podcast news sneaks in (you never know in this industry), this will be our last issue of the year. As I mentioned in my Q3 update, the podcast industry has been on an absolute heater in the second half of 2024, and the energy as we head into 2025 is at an all-time high.

For this edition, I’m going big with my 2025 podcast predictions. Think of it as a high-stakes podcast crystal ball. If I’m right, we can all celebrate together. If I’m wrong… well, feel free to remind me on LinkedIn. Either way, I’d rather take the swings than play it safe (and I did pretty well in 2024, if I do say so myself).

It’s also time for our new bi-annual tradition: The DWNLOAD Executive Insider Survey. This anonymous survey is sent to approximately 60 C-level executives across the global podcast industry. We asked:

How did podcast companies fare in 2024? 

What are their projections for 2025? 

And what’s the real verdict on Spotify’s big video push? 

The answers to these questions—and more—are just ahead.

But first, some personal updates:

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve joined Podspace as a Senior Advisor. Podspace, a rapidly growing Swedish podcast tech company, has been on a rocket ship of growth and profitability over the past 12 months. I’m excited to help drive their global expansion and contribute to the much-needed tech improvements this industry needs. If you’re in the podcast tech world, let’s talk!

Speaking of heaters, it’s gotten cold here on the Connecticut shoreline, so it’s time for a warm-up in Las Vegas! I’ll be heading to CES in a few weeks, where I’m joining executives from TikTok and Whalar to discuss “Measuring Success in the Creator Economy.” Catch us on Thursday, January 9th @ 11:45 am in the CES Creator Space. Vegas, baby!

Alright, enough housekeeping—let’s dive in!

Podcasting Predictions for 2025

1. Podcast Ad Revenue Will Outperform Projections

The IAB projected U.S. podcast ad revenue to surpass $2 billion for the first time in 2024, reflecting 12% year-over-year growth from $1.9 billion in 2023. They’ve also forecasted revenue to reach $2.6 billion by the end of 2026.

But here’s where I differ: 2024 actuals will outperform these projections.

Podcast audiences have been steadily shifting from traditional media to digital, but the revenue hasn’t fully caught up—yet. While AM/FM radio continues its decline as younger audiences flee for digital audio, podcasting has yet to see the same seismic shift in ad dollars. But 2024 might have (finally) been the turning point.

The 2024 election showcased podcasts’ unmatched ability to engage hyper-targeted, highly influential audiences. Brands—and political campaigns—would be wise to pay attention. With advancements in ad tech and better audience targeting, advertisers are finally recognizing podcasting as one of the most effective mediums for meaningful engagement.

My take? 2024 actuals will land closer to $2.2 billion, and we’ll hit $2.6 billion by 2025 as revenue begins to catch up with audience growth. The $14 billion AM/FM radio ad market won’t all migrate to podcasting, but a growing share will—and that’s exactly why podcasting is the focal point on literally every earnings call for iHeart, SiriusXM, etc. etc. etc.

2. 2025: The Year of Scale Through Rollups and M&A

2025 will be the year of scale in podcasting. Recent transactions like Acast acquiring Wonder Media Network, PodX’s continued expansion through Europe and Evergreen Podcasts acquiring Rhapsody Voices highlight the growing interest in consolidation.

After years of uncertainty, many independent networks that were forced to rethink their strategies in 2023 and 2024 now have a solid foundation of profitable companies poised to scale smartly.

While platforms like Spotify and iHeart will likely not be active buyers, other players could step in. Audacy, as it emerges from bankruptcy, may follow a playbook similar to when I led iHeart Media’s acquisition of HowStuffWorks in 2018. Additionally, larger independent networks will begin acquiring smaller studios and networks as part of their scaling strategies. There are at least two networks that I know of openly shopping with dry powder.

It’s not just audio-native companies, though. Hollywood studios, YouTube, and other media giants yet to fully move into podcasting would be wise to consider M&A over building from scratch. And as we’ll explore next, Private Equity is also positioning itself as a major buyer, bringing new capital and strategy to the industry.

3. Private Equity Will Enter the Podcast Space

2025 will be the year private equity makes its move into podcasting, specifically podcast content. With ad revenue on a steep growth trajectory and subscription models maturing, private equity firms will look to consolidate independent networks and platforms, betting big on the long-term scalability of audio-driven businesses.

We’re poised to see at least one major PE investment in the podcasting space next year—and this is just the beginning. These firms are no strangers to the IP game, having already made significant plays in film studios and music catalogs. They understand the value of content, and it’s only a matter of time before they fully recognize the unique value of audio-first content.

The opportunity is clear, and 2025 is shaping up to be the year when podcasting becomes an even bigger part of the PE playbook.

4. The Blurring of Podcasts, Video, and the Creator Economy

In 2025, we’ll continue to see the lines between podcasts, video, and the broader creator economy continue to blur. Creators will increasingly use podcasts to reach audiences on major platforms like YouTube and Spotify, leveraging their unique ability to drive deep engagement.

At the same time, podcasts will serve as the tip of the spear for launching new IP across live events, FAST channels, merchandising, and more. As more creators recognize the power of podcasting to connect with their audiences, they’ll unlock new revenue streams and engagement opportunities, solidifying podcasts as a cornerstone of the creator economy.

5. Big Personality Moves

Okay, let me preface this by saying these predictions could totally blow up in my face, but where’s the fun in playing it safe? Let’s make some bold calls about two of the biggest names in audio potentially making major moves next year:

Bill Simmons Will Leave Spotify for YouTube

Back in 2020, Bill Simmons sold The Ringer to Spotify in a deal estimated at $195 million, with incentives that could push the total closer to $250 million. Since then, The Ringer has continued to grow, but Bill’s recent focus seems less on Spotify and more on YouTube.

Here’s the evidence:

Bill consistently hosts his tentpole show, Guess the Lines with Cousin Sal, live every Sunday night on YouTube.

The Ringer NFL Show now has a Sunday morning pre-game show prominently featured on YouTube TV.

And despite Spotify’s aggressive push into video, Bill hadn’t uploaded a single video episode to Spotify… UNTIL TODAY!

Yes, for the first time ever, Bill uploaded a video version of his podcast to Spotify after more than a year of prioritizing YouTube. Yet, in the very same episode, the first promo was for a new YouTube channel for “Ringer Movies.” Soooo…?

Reports suggest Bill’s contractual obligations with Spotify may end in early 2025. Given his growing investment in YouTube—and his apparent skepticism about Spotify’s video strategy—it wouldn’t be surprising to see him make the leap to YouTube full-time.

Why this move makes sense:

YouTube’s NFL partnership is already paying $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket. The potential synergy with Bill’s sports content is obvious.

YouTube’s platform offers unmatched scale and ad monetization infrastructure, across YouTube TV, YouTube itself, and more.

Bill has produced numerous documentaries, from 30 for 30 to Netflix’s recent Mr. McMahon. Working with Google’s deep pockets could greenlight even more high-profile projects, benefiting both sides.

While Bill holds the title of Head of Podcast Innovation and Monetization at Spotify, his actions suggest limited confidence in Spotify’s video strategy.

The real question isn’t just whether Bill makes the leap to YouTube solo—it’s whether YouTube acquires The Ringer from Spotify. Without Bill, what’s The Ringer worth to Spotify anyway? Putting on my strategy cap, perhaps there’s a deal where YouTube ‘acquires’ The Ringer, then has a sales agreement with Spotify to monetize the audio ad inventory? We’ll see.

Howard Stern Will Retire, Pushing SiriusXM Further Into Podcast Content

Okay, this isn’t podcast-specific, but it does have podcast implications. 2025 could mark the end of an era as Howard Stern steps away from his daily radio show. 

As highlighted in my Q3 report, the media buzz around Kamala Harris’ interview with Alex Cooper (of SiriusXM’s Call Her Daddy) dwarfed Howard’s. And let’s be real—nobody can touch the reach of Joe Rogan’s interview with Trump. The gap between perception and reality has started to show, and while Howard (likely) still commands a loyal audience, his salary could fund multiple podcasts targeting younger, more engaged listeners—which is clearly the playbook SiriusXM is running with now. And while SiriusXM may have wanted to keep “The King of all Media” at all costs previously, they now have very popular brands like SmartLess, Conan O’Brien and Alex Cooper to showcase to investors (and listeners). To be clear, they appear to view podcast content as more than on-demand audio. They will continue to use podcast content across satellite channels and live events to drive subscriptions; creating a 360 approach, vs. the standard ad-network play. 

That said, this doesn’t mean Howard will vanish from SiriusXM entirely. I fully expect SiriusXM to maintain a dedicated Howard Stern channel, featuring his archives and involvement from personalities tied to his show. His legacy will still be a draw for listeners, even if his daily presence fades.

Another sign of change? Howard 100 and 101 no longer require a higher-tier subscription on SiriusXM, they are now available as part of the standard plan (Howard 100 and 101 used to require an additional fee in addition to your subscription) signaling a shift in strategy. I’ll also note that, when searching subscription options on SiriusXM.com, I see no mention of Howard.

Bonus Bet: Spittin’ Chiclets to Wondery/Amazon?

If I were running Wondery/Amazon, I’d be making serious moves to sign Spittin’ Chiclets to a licensing deal. Here’s why: Not only would this give Amazon the rights to sell ad inventory for the largest hockey podcast (smaller than NFL & NBA, but we love niche at DWNLOAD), but it could also seamlessly integrate the show into Amazon’s NHL coverage, which they seem to be leaning into. This would create a perfect synergy between content and sports programming, much like the model Wondery and Amazon have with the Kelce brothers (or how I expect that deal to evolve, at least).

Sure, the Spittin’ Chiclets crew seems fiercely loyal to Barstool, but this feels like a no-brainer opportunity. Let’s not forget when Alex Cooper left Barstool for Spotify, Dave Portnoy didn’t stand in the way. If the money and vision align, the Chiclets team could find a similar path.

With Amazon pushing deeper into live sports and premium content, partnering with the most popular hockey podcasts would be a win for both sides. Now the big question: Will anyone take the shot?

Alright, now, onto The DWNLOAD Executive Insider Survey. We asked ≈ 60 C-level executives in the podcast industry (primarily content-based businesses) how their company performed in 2024, their outlook on the future, and more… all anonymously. These companies include large media companies, individual studios, ad networks, and more from all over the world, so it’s quite an eclectic bunch. What we’d find out? 

The DWNLOAD Executive Insider Survey: Key Findings

1. How did your company perform in 2024 compared to your original projections?

52.4%: Met revenue projections.

46.4%: Exceeded revenue projections.

1.2%: Underperformed.

My Take:
The majority of podcast companies are doing quite well, especially compared to a softer 2023, with nearly half exceeding revenue expectations. This sets a strong precedent for scaling and innovation in 2025. Sky rockets in flight, podcasts delight!

2. The IAB projected that U.S. ad revenue would grow 12% and exceed $2 billion in 2024 (up from $1.9 billion in 2023). As we close 2024, do you expect actual ad revenue to:

57.1%: Meet IAB guidance.

41.1%: Exceed IAB guidance.

1.8%: Fall short of projections.

My Take:
Looks like I’m in the minority expecting the podcast industry to outperform original IAB guidance—but that’s okay. What’s clear from these results is that the industry is buzzing with optimism. The “good vibes” are strong, and this momentum is setting the stage for a big 2025. BTW, who are the Debbie downers that voted we’d fall short?! There’s no room for bear-ish takes on the DWNLOAD Report! (Kidding, sort of).

3. What was your largest growth area (percentage-wise) in terms of revenue?

60.5%: Ad revenue.

25%: For-hire production.

10%: Video.

4.5%: Subscription.

My Take:
Ad revenue remains the backbone of podcasting, with many networks and studios focused on building and/or expanding the sometimes slim margin, but cash-flow-positive ad network business. However, I was surprised to see 25% of companies citing for-hire work as their largest growth area. This might be influenced by non-U.S. companies, where ad revenue hasn’t grown as rapidly as in the U.S.—but it’s still a significant chunk of the results. Based on the media coverage over the past year, you’d think all that for-hire money had vanished into thin air.

As for video and subscription, they’re underperforming for now, but that won’t last long. Most every CEO I speak to is seeing these as high-priority growth areas over the next few years. These areas hold far too much-untapped potential to remain sidelined for much longer.

4. What do you see as your largest growth opportunity in 2025?

50%: Growing the size of network/impressions.

40%: Video.

10%: International expansion.

My Take:
The focus on scaling impressions highlights the maturity of the ad ecosystem, while the growing emphasis on video signals a broader multimedia shift. This aligns perfectly with our key theme for 2025: scaling networks and advancing monetization technology. It’s a theme that ties directly to the opportunities I see with Podspace, where tech innovation can push podcast monetization even further.

Meanwhile, international markets represent enormous untapped potential. This includes U.S. companies expanding overseas and international players making their move into the U.S. market. Podcasting is no longer just a local play—it’s evolving into a truly global industry.

5. If you currently distribute video podcasts, what is your strategy?

78%: Only on YouTube.

22%: “Wherever you watch your podcasts” (YouTube, Spotify, etc.).

0%: Only on Spotify.

My Take:
YouTube’s dominance in video podcasting is no surprise, but I’ll admit I was a bit surprised that only 22% of respondents are uploading to Spotify in addition to YouTube. The 0% exclusively uploading to Spotify is telling—and likely explains the flashy video event Spotify held in LA last month to announce their new partnership program. Clearly, that event solved everything and got our group of executives fully on board with Spotify’s video strategy… right? 

(Narrator: The announcement did not solve anything). 

6. How has Spotify's new monetization and video features influenced your company's strategy for adding video content on Spotify?

52%: Not at all — No plans to upload video content.

38%: Minimally — Uploaded occasional content but not a focus.

10%: Moderately — Testing the waters with limited content.

0%: Significantly — Made Spotify a key part of the strategy.

My Take:
Ummm… this is awkward. Spotify’s video push clearly hasn’t landed. With 90% of respondents either ignoring or minimally engaging with the platform, it’s obvious Spotify has some serious work to do if it wants to become a significant player in video podcasting.

In fact, I’ve heard directly from several CEOs that Spotify’s recent video announcement has made them less likely to upload content to the platform, at least for the time being. Many expressed disappointment with the direction Spotify is taking, which raises even bigger questions about how the company plans to compete in the video space. 

Tony Soprano once said, "More is lost by indecision than wrong decision." 

But, uh, in Spotify’s case, I’m not so sure this time.

7. Which platform did you see the most growth on in 2024?

44%: YouTube.

30%: Spotify.

15%: No platform outperformed meaningfully.

10%: Apple Podcasts.

1%: Amazon Music.

0%: iHeartRadio or other platforms.

My Take:

YouTube continues to cement its value for podcasters, leading in growth, while Spotify holds steady as a strong runner-up. If I had to guess, the 10% that saw the most growth on Apple Podcasts likely benefited from one of two things: a) heavy in-app marketing promotions or b) subscription growth driving their numbers.

Meanwhile, the lack of significant performance from other platforms highlights the competitive challenges smaller players face in gaining traction. This dynamic has been evident for some time, contributing to the closure of many independent podcast apps and SiriusXM’s decision to sunset Stitcher back in 2023. As the market consolidates, smaller players are increasingly pressured to innovate or risk being left behind… and does that include Apple?!

8. Which podcast platform do you see as the most important for your company in 2025+?

71.7%: YouTube

18.3%: Spotify

10%: Apple Podcasts

My Take:
Oh boy, this is telling. Back in Q2, we asked, “Which Podcast Platform Will Be The Most Important in Five Years?” and saw 50% of respondents choose Spotify, 48% YouTube, and a meager 2% Apple Podcasts. Fast forward to now, and YouTube has taken a commanding lead in importance for 2025+, while Apple continues its slide.

I cannot overstate how dominant Apple Podcasts once was. Market share was always bound to drop, but not like this. And despite their position, they still don’t have an Android app. I just don’t understand the strategy—or lack thereof.

What stands out most here is how much growth YouTube has seen in the eyes of our respondents since our last survey. Now, I’ll admit I didn’t ask the exact same question (I should have, in hindsight), but the trend is clear: YouTube is taking over. 

And the other platforms, outside of maybe Spotify, are literally letting it happen. 

And I’m not surprised by the results. They make sense. Right now, YouTube is the only platform actively working to bring new listeners/viewers to a podcast via their algorithm.

The other players? They need to step up—especially iHeartRadio and Amazon Music, which received zero votes in this survey.

Update: 12 hours after publishing, Podnews broke the news that Apple Podcasts could now be installed as an Android app… but still not available in the Google Play store.

Okay, enough of what I think—let’s hear from the 60ish C-level executives who I consider to be some of the smartest and most insightful leaders in the podcast industry.

Big Predictions from the DWNLOAD Executive Insider Survey

Will there be any big M&A deals in 2025?

The overwhelming majority agreed: Yes, deals are coming. Here are a few notable theories from respondents:

“Acast will be acquired.”

“The Ringer (Spotify) will acquire Lemonada Media.”

“More Ad-Tech M&A

My Take:
Acast was the most predicted single company for M&A, but nobody ventured a guess on who the buyer might be. That’s intriguing.

The ad-tech space is primed for innovation and forward momentum, with many platforms and content-focused companies expected to lock in their own technology solutions. This isn’t just about boosting near-term revenue; it’s about driving long-term valuations.

Ad-tech will be a major focus in 2025 and beyond. We’re just getting started.

Will there be any big licensing deals in 2025 (similar to SmartLess or New Heights)? If so, who?

Most respondents also said Yes, with some bold predictions:

“I want to say yes, but I’m not sure what big indie podcasts are left!”

“Yes, conservative media.”

“Yes, after the election, political talking heads and pundits will find new homes.”

“I don’t know who, but the buyer will be SiriusXM.”

“Bill Simmons to SiriusXM.”

My Take:
Honestly, it's a great call on Conservative Media—I think we’re going to see a ton of movement in this space in 2025. [Related: Meet the man making money for Tucker Carlson & Megyn Kelly via Peter Kafka’s Channels pod and Murdoch shop for podcasts, Semafor]

As for Bill Simmons, while we might disagree on the landing spot, I guess I’m not the only one who thinks he and Spotify are heading toward a breakup. And I agree that SiriusXM will be a major buyer in the coming months. They're perfectly positioned to swoop in on key assets, especially if I’m right about Stern.

Wrapping Up 2024: The DWNLOAD Report Goes Out on a High Note

As 2024 comes to a close, one thing is clear: the podcast industry is thriving, evolving, and heading into 2025 with momentum we haven’t seen in years. From record ad revenues, the “podcast election,” and the growing influence of video, to the challenges still facing platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts, the landscape is more dynamic than ever.

We’ve witnessed smart scaling from companies, booming international markets, and creators doubling down on engagement opportunities across the creator economy. While this evolution hasn’t come without its challenges, the resilience and adaptability of the podcast industry are what set it apart.

Looking ahead, the predictions in this report reflect an industry at a pivotal moment. From the blurring lines between audio, video, and broader IP opportunities to the rise of ad-tech innovation and AI tools streamlining production, the groundwork laid in 2024 is set to fuel a transformative 2025.

And as I’ve been saying for the last two years: podcasting remains the most undervalued medium, overlooked by investors for the last 18+ months. But that is changing—and I’m proud if my efforts have played even a small part in moving the needle. And to those investors that have tolerated my constant badgering, thank you. 

When I started writing these reports, it was out of frustration. I wanted to push back against what I saw as misguided perceptions about the podcast industry from some very smart and savvy investors. The first DWNLOAD Report was a 4,000-word manifesto, supposed to be a one-off, which went on to reach over 100,000 views in the week after its release. From there, it grew. I began sending out quarterly updates, and now, it’s reaching an extremely influential audience of investors and decision-makers… and hopefully, making an impact. 

Thanks for being part of it. I’m excited to see what 2025 holds—not just for this newsletter, but for the podcast industry itself. Stay tuned… who knows what this may turn into in the year ahead.

Cheers to what’s next,
